***Node-core streams for userland***

This package is a mirror of the Streams2 and Streams3 implementations in
Node-core, including [documentation](doc/stream.markdown).

If you want to guarantee a stable streams base, regardless of what version of
Node you, or the users of your libraries are using, use **readable-stream** *only* and avoid the *"stream"* module in Node-core, for background see [this blogpost](http://r.va.gg/20
